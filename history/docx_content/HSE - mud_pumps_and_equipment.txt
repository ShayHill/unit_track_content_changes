Mud Pumps and Equipment



Policy



Use the caustic mixer to mix caustic soda.



Do not mix other chemicals in the caustic mixer.



Perform a lock-out / tag-out before working on a pressurized system. Routine maintenance of hydraulic tools and other equipment does not require a lock-out / tag-out if the pressurized system will not be affected. These operations may require a lock-out / tag-out for other reasons.

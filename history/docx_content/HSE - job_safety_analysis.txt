Job Safety Analysis



Policy



For every job, every time:



Wear standard PPE (gloves, hard hat, safety glasses, and safety-toed boots).

Inspect tools and equipment before the job.

Review applicable Safety Data Sheets.

Walk every carry. Before manually carrying a load, walk the path to identify potential obstacles and slip hazards.

Perform a Job Safety Analysis.

Hold a toolbox talk at the job site to ensure all participants understand the steps, risks, and controls.

Exercise <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d6">Stop Work Authority</a> if personnel, equipment, or the environment appear to be at risk.



Create or review a documented, approved Job Safety Analysis before beginning



--	any job requiring a <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d4">Work Permit</a>; or

--	any job with a foreseeable risk to personnel, equipment, or the environment.



Perform a verbal Job Safety Analysis before beginning other jobs.



Make completed Job Safety Analysis forms available for review and update by on-site personnel.



See KPA form <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/forms">Job Safety Analysis Assessment</a>.

	c)	Identify and control hazards for any deviation, however small, from the job steps in a pre-written Job Safety Analysis.

	d)	Sign to acknowledge understanding of the Job Safety Analysis.

	e)	Update the Job Safety Analysis as tools, personnel, work scope, or conditions change.

4)	The Rig Manager will

	a)	Collect any written forms for the yearly rig folder.

5)	The HSE Manager will

	a)	Review completed Job Safety Analysis forms.

	b)	Determine if new Job Safety Analyses are useful to other rigs and share them as necessary.

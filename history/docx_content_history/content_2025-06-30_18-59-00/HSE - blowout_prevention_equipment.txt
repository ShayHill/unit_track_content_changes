Policy



Tighten BOP nuts until at least one full thread of the bolt or stud is showing on the side of the nut opposite the bolt head or stud attachment.



Nippleing Up and Down



--	Do not climb on BOP components until they are set and bolted.

--	Only torque or break BOP bolts with closed-socket hammer wrenches or hydraulic equipment.

--	Bleed all hydraulic lines to zero before breaking any unions.

--	Do not lift BOP Equipment over 25,000 pounds with chain or wire-rope slings, even if they are rated for the weight of the BOP Equipment.

--	Install a safety guard or latch over the accumulator blind-ram control.



In Use



--	When the rams are closed, leave the controls in the closed position. Tag out the driller’s controls to indicate that the rams are in the closed position.

--	When using a circulating head, do not use dresser sleeves on mud return lines or gas control systems.

--	Keep all flanges, including flow lines and separators, fully bolted.

--	Label all controls on the BOP accumulator.

--	Label all controls on the BOP remote.

--	Use a snub line on all flexible pressured mud lines.

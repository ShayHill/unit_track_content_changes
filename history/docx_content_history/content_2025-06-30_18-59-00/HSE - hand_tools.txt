Hand Tools



Policy



Cover the well or mousehole before working near the rotary table with hand tools.



Only use tools in factory condition with all guards in place.



Do not use hammers or striking tools with mushroomed or damaged heads.



Do not jump or stand on wrenches, chain tongs, or other tools.



Do not strike wrenches or hand tools with a hammer unless they are designed for that purpose.



Two personnel are required to use a hammer wrench: one will hold the wrench tight with a rope or tool lanyard, and the second will strike the wrench.



Do not modify equipment.



Don’t lock power tools or equipment in the “on” position:

--	Do not tie back pressure washer triggers.

--	Do not use bands or straps to hold down power tool or pneumatic tool switches.



Cheater Bars



Do not use a cheater bar on a crescent wrench.



Do not use a cheater bar more than twice the length of the tool handle.



Do not use a cheater bar that does not fit securely and completely over the entire tool handle.



Do not use a combination end wrench to extend the handle of another combination-end wrench.



In other circumstances, you may use a cheater bar as a last resort after performing a documented risk assessment and evaluating other possible solutions.

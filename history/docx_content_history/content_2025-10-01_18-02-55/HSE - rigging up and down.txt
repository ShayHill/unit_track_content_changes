Rigging Up and Down



Policy



These policies affect common rig-up and rig-down operations, but are applicable at all times.



Verify the power is off before connecting or disconnecting electrical lines. (220 and up). This rule applies at all times.



Open (turn off) the breaker before removing plugs on electrical lines.



Use tag lines when positioning single-crane loads.



Do not operate aerial lifts or other lifting or mobile equipment that is not standard on the rig, unless you have been trained to operate that specific piece of equipment.

Lock Out Tag Out



Policy



Complete this process before performing maintenance or any operation where unexpected start-up or release of energy could cause injury or damage.



Do not operate any equipment with an isolation lock or tag in place.



Every isolation will have a Unit Drilling lock.



Identify faulty or defective equipment with an Out of Service tag. Attach an Out of Service tag to equipment during maintenance.



Do not shut down, re-start, isolate, or bleed equipment unless you have been trained to take these steps and evaluate the specific risks.



Maintain an isolation log by entering isolations into KPA where practicable. Where this is not practicable, document isolations in one isolation logbook, located in the drive house.



Complete the shutdown process in this document before shutting down or starting up the generators.



Locks and Tags



Use purpose-made isolation locks and purpose-made isolation tags for connected breakers.



Use purpose-made isolation locks and smaller, “not in use” tags for breakers that are not connected to equipment.



Record both types of isolation in KPA. Reserve the isolation logbook, if necessary, for connected breakers.



Work on Electrical Equipment



Only site supervisors (Rig Managers, Shop Supervisors, or higher) or licensed electrical contractors will



--	work on electrical equipment;

--	splice electrical wire; or

--	cut electrical wire.



Work Permits



Acquire an authorized <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d4">Work Permit</a> before



--	isolating equipment;

--	working on isolated equipment; or

--	de-isolating equipment.



Short-Term Isolation



A short-term isolation is any isolation less than 120 hours (5 days). For a short-term isolation, the drilling crews will hold and control the keys.



Long-Term Isolation



A long-term isolation is any isolation at least 120 hours, including not-in-use breakers. For a long-term isolation, the Rig Manager will hold and control the keys.

2)	The Permit Authorized Person will

	a)	Notify affected employees that lockout and tag-out is about to occur.

	b)	Shut down the equipment using normal operating controls.

	c)	Isolate energy to the equipment.

	d)	Bleed or release stored energy.

	e)	Attach a lock and tag to each isolating device.

	f)	Document isolation and lock number in an isolation log.

	g)	Verify the isolation

		--	Attempt to start isolated equipment with normal controls.

		--	Return equipment controls to “off” after attempt.

		--	Where possible, verify isolation with calibrated meters or gauges.

3)	Personnel will

	a)	Attach one lock and one tag for each person who might be injured if an unexpected startup occurred.

	b)	Attach an Out of Service tag to isolated equipment.

4)	For an isolation lasting 120 hours or less, the Permit Authorized Person (on <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/forms">Lockout/Tagout Verification Form SAF-RIG-7.5</a>, this person will be the ‘Senior Affected Employee’) will

	a)	Place the isolation key in a secure lock box in the VFD house.

5)	For an isolation expected to last 120 hours or more, the Permit Authorized Person will

De-Isolation



1)	Only the person who performed the isolation or their designated replacement (relief) will

	a)	Acquire a work permit before de-isolating equipment.

	b)	Notify affected employees that the isolation will be removed.

	c)	Verify no personnel are near the equipment to be re-energized.

	d)	Remove locks then tags (in that order).

	e)	Restore energy to the equipment.



Shut Down Generators



1)	The person in charge of the isolation will

Restart Generators



1)	The person in charge of the isolation will

	a)	Request and obtain an authorized Permit to Work.

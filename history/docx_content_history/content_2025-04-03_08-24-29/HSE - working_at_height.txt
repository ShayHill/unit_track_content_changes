Working at Height



Policy



Working at Height is entering, exiting, or occupying:



1)	any walking or working surface 4 feet or more above lower levels

2)	any walking or working surface above exposed hazardous equipment

3)	any portable or fixed ladder 6 feet or more above lower levels

4)	any position within 6 horizontal feet of 1 or 2

5)	any ladder or platform within [6 horizontal feet plus ladder or platform height] of 1 or 2

6)	any ladder or platform within [6 horizontal feet plus ladder or platform height] of a guardrail

7)	any work basket, mobile work platform, or suspended work platform at any height above lower levels



Use guardrails, nets, or 100% tie off when working at height.



The Rig Manager will identify and mark fall hazards during rig up, rig down, and other operations which compromise the engineered fall protection controls on the rig. This applies to areas which would normally be free of fall hazards or are expected to be free of fall hazards.



Install barriers or tape around these areas



Unit personnel and contractors will only use the following to protect from fall hazards.



self-retracting lanyards

anchor points capable of supporting 5000 pounds per employee attached (a handrail is not an acceptable anchor point)

shock-absorbing lanyards no longer than 6 feet

self-locking snap hooks, d-rings, and carabiners

purpose-made horizontal or vertical lifeline devices

Lad-Safe™ or similar vertical climbing systems

(only) full-body harnesses with trauma straps, no older than ten years from manufacture date

other purpose-made fall protection equipment that does not conflict with the above



All fall-protection equipment will be:



rated for the user’s weight plus tools

purpose made for fall protection

manufactured by a company specializing in fall protection

used only for fall protection and never previously used for another purpose (Harnesses may be used to attach confined-space retrieval systems)



Personnel above 300 pounds (including clothing and tools) will not use a personal fall-arrest system without documented approval from the EHS Manager.



Where self-rescue may not be easy or straightforward, do not work at height without a safety watch.



Tie off all tools when working above 8 feet.



Use caution or danger tape to mark areas beneath overhead work.



Only qualified personnel will work at height.



Rig Equipment



Mast – Use a vertically mounted fall-protection device on the mast ladder.



Exemptions



Unit Drilling has determined that use of standard fall protection (guardrails, nets, or personal fall-arrest systems) is not feasible or would produce a greater hazard for the following operations:



Standing up or laying down handrails on the mud pits during rig-up or rig-downs

Hot Work



Policy



Only qualified welders will operate welding equipment.



Only qualified personnel will perform atmospheric tests or atmospheric monitoring.



Hot work includes welding, chipping, burning, heating, grinding, abrasive blasting, brazing, soldering, any spark-producing activity, and any activity with a potential to start a fire or ignite an atmosphere.



Hot work is treated as “high potential”



within 150 radial feet of the well head

inside any permit-controlled confined space

where a flammable or toxic atmosphere may exist or develop

where there is potential for a moderate to severe fire



Complete the “high potential” procedure before hot work in a confined space or within 150 radial feet of the well head. High potential hot work requires a <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d4">Work Permit</a>.



For work outside confined spaces and outside 150 radial feet of the well head, the driller or assistant driller will determine if hot work is “high potential”.



Procedure



High Potential



1)	The person requesting the<a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d4">Work Permit</a> will

	a)	Specify the exact fire-response and personal-protective equipment to be used on the <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d2">Job Safety Analysis</a> to be submitted with the Work Permit.

	b)	Submit a pre-job atmospheric test for authorization with the<a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d4">Work Permit</a>

		--	Perform tests in this order.

		--	Oxygen: greater than 19.5% and less than 23.5%

		--	Flammable gases and vapors: < 0%

		--	Hydrogen Sulfide: < 10 ppm

		--	Carbon Monoxide: < 35 ppm

2)	The Permit Authorized Person will

	a)	Assign a fire watch. This duty can be re-assigned as the job progresses.

	b)	Where possible, remove all combustible materials within 30 radial feet at or below the hot work.

	c)	Where combustible materials cannot be removed, cover combustible materials with fire-retardant blankets or shields.

3)	The Fire Watch will

	a)	Continuously monitor the hot work and potentially affected areas.

	b)	Remain at the work site 30 minutes after the hot work is complete.



Low Potential



1)	Work crews will

	a)	Specify the exact fire-response and personal-protective equipment to be used on the Job Safety Analysis.

2)	The Driller or Assistant Driller will

	a)	Determine if the hot work is “high potential”.

	b)	Determine if a fire watch is required.

	c)	Sign the <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d2">Job Safety Analysis</a>.

3)	The Fire Watch (if required) will

	a)	Continuously monitor the hot work and potentially affected areas.

	b)	Remain at the work site 30 minutes after the hot work is complete.



Safe Welding Areas



1)	The Rig or Facility Manager will

	a)	Designate, record, and mark the locations of Safe Welding Areas.

2)	Work crews will

	a)	Specify the exact fire-response and personal-protective equipment to be used on the <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2d2">Job Safety Analysis</a>.

Ladder Safety



Policy



See minimum requirements for portable ladders in<a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2da">Ladder Safety – Ladder Inspection Prompt</a>.



A competent person will inspect ladders before use, following the <a href="https://unitcorp.kpaehs.com/rsc/67c4bf36d7480a0012d5a2da">Ladder Safety – Ladder Inspection Prompt</a>.



Do not climb or stand on the top step of a stepladder or the top two steps of an extension ladder.



Face the ladder when climbing.



Follow the “belt buckle rule” on portable ladders. Do not lean far enough out that your belt buckle would not be between the ladder uprights.



Tie off portable extension and straight ladders where possible. Where this is not possible, have another person hold the ladder from the ground.



Only one person on a ladder at a time.



Follow all recommendations on the<a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/portable_ladder_qc.pdf">OSHA Portable Ladder Safety Quick Card</a>

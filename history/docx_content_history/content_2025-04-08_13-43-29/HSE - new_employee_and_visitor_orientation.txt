New Employee and Visitor Orientation



Policy



Visitors, new employees on first assignment, and employees transferred from other locations will attend a visitor orientation. Visitor orientation expires and must be repeated each year.



Personnel arriving to work after the pre-tour meeting will check in with the Rig Manager or Driller on tour before entering the worksite. A phone call meets this requirement.



Personnel will complete a Rig Pass or Safe Land course before entering a Unit Drilling worksite. A Rig Superintendent can provide documented, provisional access to a worksite for a maximum of 30 days while the Rig Pass or Safe Land class is scheduled. An e-mail from the Rig Superintendent meets the requirement for documented, provisional access.

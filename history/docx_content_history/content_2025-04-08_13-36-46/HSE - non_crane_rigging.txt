Non-Crane Rigging



Policy



This policy applies to



--	rigging activities that do not involve cranes (e.g., chain hoist, chain fall, tugger, block and tackle, forklift, come-along)

--	rigging activities that involve cranes and non-crane lifting equipment together (e.g., drifting a crane lift with a come-along)

--	suspending a load from a forklift (loads attached beneath the forks)



Restrictions



--	Never use chains to wrap, choke, or basket a load.

--	Never hook more than 1 lifting or pulling device into 1 engineered pick point (e.g., lifting eye).

--	Never use chain hoists or chain falls that are not hanging vertically.

--	Never hook chain hoists, come-alongs, chain falls or similar back to their own chains (instead, use a choker sling, nylon lifting strap, or double-wrapped wire rope to choke a lift).

--	Never use rigging with less than a 5-to-1 safety factor (e.g., clevises, turn buckles, wire ropes, nylon straps, swivel picks, beam clamps, etc).

--	Never use a lifting device with less than a 5-to-1 safety factor for tandem lifts (lifts with two or more lifting devices).

--	Never exceed rated capacity of a lifting device.

--	Never work under elevated loads.

--	Use US-manufactured shackles and turnbuckles.  Do not use shackles or turnbuckles without a cast-on working-load limit (no stamped or [only] tagged shackles or turnbuckles).

--	Never use rigging without a legible tag, permanently affixed or visible load rating.

--	Never stand between a suspended load and a stationary object.

--	Never use carbon steel rigging against stainless steel.

Use push sticks for casing.



Do not walk or stand on tubulars.



Secure each layer of stacked tubulars with engineered chocking blocks.



Install stops at the ends of pipe racks.



Only use ratchet-type binders. Remove lever or chain type binders from the worksite if found.



Maintain a 50-foot distance from the catwalk when picking up or laying down pipe with the pipe handler or a laydown truck.

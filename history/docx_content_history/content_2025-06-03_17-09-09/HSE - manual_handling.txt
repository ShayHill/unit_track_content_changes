Manual Handling



Policy



No one person will lift or carry items over 80 lbs. This includes lifting or carrying multiple lighter items at the same time.



Where possible, use a lifting appliance like a forklift or dolly.



Before carrying a lift with two hands, walk the entire lift empty handed to check for obstacles.



Do not carry two-handed loads up or down stairways. If a load cannot be carried with one hand, use a lifting appliance.

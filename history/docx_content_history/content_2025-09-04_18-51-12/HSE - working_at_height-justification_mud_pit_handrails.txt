Working at Height – Mud Pit Handrails



Unit Drilling has determined that use of standard fall protection (guardrails, nets, or personal fall-arrest systems) is not feasible or would produce a greater hazard for the raising and lowering handrails on the mud pits during rig up and rig down.



Conventional fall protection poses the following risks



--	Working from ladders would require pulling laterally to position the handrails, risking pulling the ladders over.

--	There is insufficient clearance around the mud pits to position an aerial work platform or other mobile elevated work platform.

--	The surface on the mud pits is designed to provide ventilation and is not constructed to support the forces generated by fall-arrest systems. There are no suitable anchor points on the mud pits themselves for lanyards or lifelines.

--	Any potential anchor point on the roof would require standing on a ladder on top of the mud pits before the rails were in place or after they had been laid down.

--	The mud pit roof is removed and shipped separately. Semi-permanent attachment of a self-retracting lanyard is not feasible.

--	The fall distance, approximately 7 feet, is not great enough to make a net feasible.

--	Workers reposition themselves more often than once per minute. Repositioning fall-protection devices would more than double the time spent working on the elevated surface without handrails.



The risks of working without conventional fall protection are smaller



--	Workers are lifting or lowering handrails from a kneeling position.

--	The handrails fold in, so workers have no reason to pass less than 42” from the edge of the mud pits without the handrails in place.

--	The maximum potential fall height is 10 feet.

--	The only activity taking place is the raising or lowering of handrails. There is no potential for workers, occupied with other tasks, to inadvertently walk over an edge. All attention is directed towards safely raising and lowering the handrails, minimizing the risk of falls due to distractions or other activities.



Required Controls



--	Unit drilling will use a dedicated standby person to observe and advise personnel.

--	Personnel will work under an approved Job Risk Assessment.

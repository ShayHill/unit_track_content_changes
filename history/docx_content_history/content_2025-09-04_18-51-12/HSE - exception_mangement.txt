Exception Management



Policy



Unit Drilling will always strive to meet or exceed



--	local regulatory standards at our work locations; and

--	client requirements in our contracts and bridging documents.



In many cases, our HSE policy intentionally exceeds these requirements to increase safety or decrease complexity. Rare circumstances or unanticipated events can create a situation where we should maintain compliance while temporarily altering our strategy to maintain compliance.



These circumstances or events might include



--	extreme weather events

--	missing or alternate personnel

--	unanticipated loss of communication or network

--	bypassing engineered safety controls

--	etc.



Any temporary exceptions to an HSE policy or procedure will be reviewed and re-authorized weekly. Permanent changes to the HSE manual will take place through the Management of Change procedure.

	a)	Submit a request in writing. This request will include

		--	the policy, procedure, directive, or expectation for which an exception is requested

		--	a detailed alternate means of ensuring safety and conformance

2)	The Rig Superintendent and HSE Manager will

	a)	Review the exception request.

	b)	Provide documented authorization.

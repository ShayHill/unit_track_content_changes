Grounding and Bonding



Policy



Grounding



Ground all metallic skids, houses, and equipment.



Ground all portable equipment with a metal housing.



Ground ungrounded motors and powered equipment individually to the ground or a grounded skid. Agitator motors are grounded through the power supply, so no external ground wires are needed for agitator motors.



To ground equipment, connect equipment directly to a ground rod or to a structure that is connected to a ground rod.



Bonding



Use a bonding strap when transferring fuel or other flammable liquid to or from a vehicle.



Connect bonding strap before opening the cover of a fuel container.



Extension Cords



Only use 3-prong (grounded) extension cords.



Do not use pigtail adapters.
